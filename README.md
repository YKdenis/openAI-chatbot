# Getting Started

To run the application locally you should start by obtaining an openAI private key. You can generate a key by visiting the following [page](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Once you've obtained a key, add an `.env` file to your local project. Define a new variabele `OPENAI_API_KEY` inside the `.env` file and give it the value of your openAI private key.

## Run the Development server

If you've followed the above instructions you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and talk to Chiddy. :)

You can ask him anything!
